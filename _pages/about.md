Originally from South Africa, I have a keen interest in all things tech and use this blog to post my observations on the industry. I am currently the Senior Product Analyst working on intelligent currency routing for TransferWise's Borderless Account. Previously, I was the Product Analyst in iZettle's Growth team where my focus was on activating new users into developing a habit around taking in-store card payments. Prior to starting my career in tech, I was a Management Consultant.
