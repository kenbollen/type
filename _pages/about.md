Originally from South Africa and now living in the U.K, I have a keen interest in all things tech and use this blog to post my observations on the industry. I'm currently a Senior Product Analyst working on TransferWise's Borderless Account. Previously, I worked as a Product Analyst in iZettle's product growth team where my focus was on the activation of new users. Prior to starting my career in tech, I was a Management Consultant.
