##### Introduction

The history of the music industry is a litany of innovative disruptions that has brought us LPs, Cassettes, CDs, MP3s and now music streaming. Though the latest innovation on how we consume our music has for the first time altered the dynamic of the music industry and a host of music streaming services are now jostling to obtain the required number of subscribers to reach the network effects that will allow a dominance in the new market. This blog will look at the 3 business models I believe will be make the biggest impact on capturing market share and who I think will most likely be triumphant in the music streaming wars.

##### Spotify: Freemium

Spotify came onto the scene by offering free music streaming to its users. The freemium model is nothing new to the music industry as a strategy deployed by radio stations for decades by offering listeners free music that is subsidized by advertisements.

The justification for the model is based on the thesis that once you drive users onto the platform and they see the value of the service first hand, they will be more willing to pay the subscription for the extra features and content. Largely, Spotify has been proved correct attaining the lead market share in 2016 at 40 million paying subscribers dwarfing their nearest competitors. Based on their two tier pricing model where users can listen to music advertisement free at $9.99 a month, Spotify generated $2.2 billion in revenue for 2015, which represented an impressive 80% increase from their 2014 revenue of $1.21 billion. However, their business model looks to fall apart when investigating their costs. The strength of the music labels’ bargaining power dictates significant royalty pay-outs at 83% of their top line at $1.8 billion.

Funnel conversation is therefore a hugely important metric for Spotify as their ability to convert non-paying users into subscribers will define their success. Currently, there is a significant unpaid tier at a 100 million non-paying users that could give Spotify a crippling market share and prime their IPO valuation. This has seen Spotify pivot their M&A targets from front-end companies that have improved their UX towards back-end data science companies that reduce churn and improve subscription conversion rates. Furthermore, Spotify works on increasing their users switching costs by creating features (Spotify Singles and Playlists) that entrench users into their service and solidify their market share.

##### Tidal: Exclusivity

It’s fair to say that the acquisition by Rapper Jay Z for $56 million in March 2015 firmly put Tidal onto the music streaming map by transforming the service into a premium service that boasted exclusive content by the some of the biggest musicians in the industry. Youtube and Spotify’s introduction of music streaming heavily disrupted the music industry’s revenue stream at a time when they had just managed to wrestle music fans’ addiction off pirated content by moving towards an on-demand micro payment model (aka iTunes).

Therein laid Jay-Z’s proposition to the music industry, a streaming platform that puts the power back into musicians hands by compensating them appropriately for their music and in-return, musicians would release their content exclusively to the Tidal platform and starve Spotify’s freeloading users. Musicians loved the concept with some of the biggest names in the industry signing up to be co-owners but evidence of its success would only be seen when Kanye West released his much anticipated Life of Pablo exclusively on Tidal for 3 months

Tidal is a payment subscription service only and offers subscribers two payment tiers at $9.99 per month for complete access and $19.99 per month for a premium service that provides music aficionados high-fidelity streaming. At 3 million subscribers, Tidal has managed to convince 45% of its user base to sign-up for the premium service, making its monthly revenue at around $40 million

As a service that is primarily owned by various musicians, my assumption is that they will have a greater ability to drive down their royalty pay-out costs compared to Spotify and Apple Music.

##### Apple Music: Platform Economics

Considering the myopic-ness that normally plagues companies the size of Apple, credit must be given to Tim Cook’s ability to evolve from a micro-payment model towards a music subscription model, albeit a bit late to the party. Though hitting 20 million subscribers within 18 months is impressive (it took Spotify 4 years), it still only represents roughly 50% of Spotify’s market share.

Unlike its fellow music streaming rivals, Apple Music is not a stand-alone service where a sustainable business model will define their business. Apple sees streaming as a part of their overall mobile strategy to encourage sales of its flagship iPhone. This fundamental difference is what sets them apart from their rivals as they can treat streaming as a loss-leader and undercut their rivals to capture market share. Therefore, Apple music can take a dual strategy of releasing exclusive content via the like of Drake and create Spotify-like personalised features through curated playlists from international DJs. As long as Apple Music serves to boost the appeal of iPhone releases, they have the ability to outspend their rivals over the long term as seen by their 3-month free trial offer.

##### So, how does this playout?

The music streaming market is close to a saturation with most future growth coming from the untapped Asian markets. Therefore a likely consolidation within the market will occur with my prediction of Spotify and Apple Music being the dominate players.

Apple Music, backed by Apple’s war chest of billions, will most likely embark on an acquisition spree that sees the chance to acquire Tidal’s exclusivity platform as the key to driving its user-base. The financial might of Apple will see it able to either driver the other “small” players out or buy out their businesses. Tidal, the strongest of the rest recognises this and there have been strong rumours of discussions with Apple and Samsung to sell off their business.

Spotify unable to compete head-on with the exclusivity model will be in search of organic growth from untapped markets, which has seen them enter the Japanese market for the first time in Q4 of 2016. Japan is a hugely lucrative market for music where sales are estimated at nearly $3 billion per year which makes it the world’s second largest market behind only the U.S. However, it’s a market that is still accustomed to purchasing musical physically, which is representative of most Asian markets. Spotify’s freemium model will have the advantage in these type of markets in their ability to gain momentum among users who are not used to paying for digital music consumption.

Though I predict the creation of a type of duopoly, my sense is that the exclusivity model combined with Apple’s platform will become the mainstream option and capture the lion share of the market as users seek to have an Omni-channel where access to all their preferred music can be easily found on their everyday devices. Spotify’s moves into recording songs from artists in its in-house New York studio would seem to appeal more to a niche segment of independent music providers. If the rumours of Spotify’s interest in acquiring the largest independent music streaming service SoundCloud are true, my prediction is that Spotify will rebrand themselves as a music streaming service for independent and alternative music.

##### Notes and Assumptions

1) I make the assumption that since Tidal is a streaming service owned by the artists that there royalty pay-outs will be limited to only the music labels. This is a simplified assumption as it’s very likely that not all of Tidal’s music catalogue will include artists that are co-owners of Tidal and there will be a percentage that still needs to be paid out to these artists. I have taken 40% as a simple assumption that the 80% that Spotify pays out is equally distributed between the music labels and artists, though this varies greatly depending on the popularity of the artist

2) I assume that because Tidal business model is based on exclusive music releases and high-fidelity streaming to attract subscribers, there is no spending on further R&D to attract users. This assumption is used to purely contrast the Tidal and Spotify business models.

3) Assumption that Apple Music is unable to negotiate more favourable terms with record companies and music artists and pay a similar 83% of their top-line in royalty pay-outs. This is a reasonable assumption considering that record labels have part-ownership of Spotify and the demonstrated bargaining of Taylor Swift over Apple Music

4) As Apple Music deploys a similar strategy of offering a freemium option to users (They have a 3-month free trial) they require R&D spending to convert non-paying users and create lock-in effects similar to Spotify. Therefore, I have taken the assumption that Apple Music similarly spends 1% of their revenue on R&D.
