##### Who are HelloFresh?

It’s hard to begrudge Jamie Oliver a laugh after signing a 3-year deal with one of Europe’s most highly valued tech start-ups, HelloFresh. Valued at $2.9 billion, HelloFresh’s ascendency to Unicorn* status within 4-years is nothing short of remarkable and should be considered a testament to the strength of their business model. A business that has in recent time been flirting with the idea of an IPO, has based much of their success on redefining people's relationship with home-cooked meals. However, behind the excitement of their lofty valuation is a subscription based service that delivers to their customers all the ingredients they require for a weekly meal plan with accompanying recipes that create healthy home-cooked meals. Sounds simple enough, right?

##### What makes them unique?

“Our customers tell us we deliver inspiration: you will get us out of the daily rut, you get us out of cooking always the same five meals. I think that’s a huge selling point”  - Dominik Richter (Co-Founder & CEO)

On offer to consumers are three different subscription services aimed at vegetarians, families and couple households that provides them with the ingredients to cook 3-5 meals during a week. Every week, customers choose their meal plan before Wednesday and select a delivery day between Sunday and Tuesday for their weekly meals to arrive. By keeping it simple on the customer-side of their operations, it liberates HelloFresh to execute in a highly efficient manner with long lead-times and low inventory stock.

[Unlike traditional supermarkets that store from 20,000 - 30,000](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/30/tesco-cuts-range-products) stock-keeping units (SKUs), HelloFresh focuses on 18-26 produce items that are sourced from selected local producers. By creating long delivery lead-times through their Wednesday order cut-off date coupled with their low SKUs, HelloFresh is able to  forecast their demand over a [8-week time span with 90%-95% accuracy](https://www.producebusinessuk.com/purchasing/stories/2015/07/01/hellofresh-in-continuing-quest-to-forge-closer-grower-relationships) and can subsequently buy wholesale from their suppliers with minimal waste. This business model has the added benefit for setting very clear margin expectations across their products and allowing HelloFresh to set prices at a level where fluctuations won’t punish them.  

HelloFresh is relentless about finding efficiencies in their supply chain and that is most evident in the delivery of their products as they concluded they would be better off not allowing their customers to choose their delivery time slots. By simply omitting this option it enables HelloFresh to optimise their routes and delivery schedule, which ensures that van drivers can reach the maximum number of homes while travelling the minimum distance and spending the least time on delivery. This has been credited to saving [HelloFresh 40% in fuel costs and increasing deliveries fourfold with only 50% more vans.](https://www.truckstopsrouting.com/hellofresh-increase-home-deliveries-fourfold-with-truckstops/)

Central to HelloFresh business model is simplicity. However, does that translate into profitability?

##### So, how does it make money?

HelloFresh’s revenue grew an [impressive 338%](https://www.ft.com/content/50efb818-16cd-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e#axzz49Odp0ptQ) from last year but has yet to make a profit as it looks to expand their product offering globally.

Costs have been increasing in absolute terms for the Berlin-based start-up but relative to the revenues it has been generating, their margins have been stable despite the increase in costs

HelloFresh is in enviable position because despite them making a yearly loss, their business model is inherently profitable. Being an expanding business, HelloFresh is completely focused on growing their sales internationally, capturing market share in new markets and fighting off rivals such as Blue Apron and Plated.

By foregoing profit in the near-term thanks to the strong backing of their investors, HelloFresh looks to refine their product-offering, streamline their operations and create a greater awareness of their brand. Once HelloFresh changes gears and moves into the profit lane, an average couple household purchasing their bestseller product (The Classic Box) could generate them the following:

HelloFresh generates revenue solely from the sale of their recipe boxes, which can vary depending the frequency of meals and the number of people per meal. Using their bestseller product, the “Classic Box” at £39 per box, if a customer were to subscribe to their service for a month, they could look to spend around £150 on 4 weekly meals.

In terms of costs, using the prices listed by HelloFresh’s suppliers, it would cost around £100 to construct a meal plan. It would be fair to say that the prices listed by suppliers isn’t a fair representation of costs that HelloFresh would pay as they would be able to negotiate more favourable terms with larger and more frequent orders.

##### How does the future look?

The logical step in the HelloFresh growth trajectory is to list their company’s shares to the public through an IPO, after 5 rounds of funding from private investors that has raised over $255.5 million. This seemed to be the strategy until late last year when they pulled the plug on their planned IPO, as investor sentiment towards tech companies changed for the negative as many believed their valuations weren’t representative of their underlying business models and a fear of a growing tech bubble. It would seem in the short-term that HelloFresh made the correct call as they didn’t need access to further capital as the evidence showed they had [a strong position on their balance sheet and cash position.](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/558f26dbe4b01c6273ea34d4/t/5722214ee707eb71b7bcc44d/1461854543065/HelloFresh+2015+Financial+Results.pdf)

With greater investor scrutiny on tech companies ability to sustainably make a profit, I would speculate that HelloFresh would only seek an IPO once they pivot from their growth strategy to a profit-making strategy. Therefore, HelloFresh will likely look to expand from their 7 geographical locations and make a potential push into the Asian market where a culture of home-cooked meals with their families and rise of longer working hours might play into their hands. HelloFresh will need to make an aggressive push into these markets and prove to the street they can be profitable as a latest CB Insights report suggests that [venture capital funding to unicorn companies is on the decline](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/venture-capital-fall/) due to questionable valuations and poor performance. Any future funding will most likely need to come from the public market.

Despite the uncertainty that lays ahead, one thing is for certain, the way we shop and cook for food will likely be reshaped by modern technology and a couple of Jamie Oliver inspired recipes.
