##### Who are AirBnb?

As folklore stories go, Silicon Valley is rife of tales of missed opportunities, last minute deals and entrepreneurs that overcame deep skepticism to prove their doubters wrong. Airbnb fits into that third category as the often told story about how co-founders Brain Chesky and Joe Gebbia, who could barely make rent, decided to build a website that offered a night on their air mattress with breakfast included to three strangers for $80. With their initial success, Air Bed & Breakfast was born. However, in the pre sharing-economy era of Uber, the concept was ridiculed as unscalable because who would want to rent out their place to strangers? Today, Airbnb is a community marketplace that boasts over 500,000 listings in 192 countries that brings together people who want to share their homes with people who are looking for a unique travel experience.

##### What makes them unique?

Airbnb operates through a C2C online marketplace model that provides a platform for people looking to rent out their homes for a duration of time. Hosts provide details of their listing in terms of price, location, availability and amenities that Airbnb uses to create an aggregated view of various properties that fit guests required criteria. After a guest finds their ideal holiday home, they make a booking request via Airbnb, which is either accepted or rejected by the host. If the host agrees, Airbnb charges the payment and contact information is exchanged. This is actually the basic tenants of operating an e-commerce marketplace, where Airbnb start differentiating themselves to transform their business into a scalable model is by setting up a framework of trust.

In order to scale their business, Airbnb faced a huge task to change a mind-set that was reluctant on sharing with strangers. To make it more appealing, Airbnb made a bet that if they provided professional photography to listed homes and required users to upload a photo of themselves, they would erode the doubt of jumping into the unknown and create a more personal feeling between the two users. The bet proved correct when in 2011, Airbnb hired 20 photographers to take professional photographs of listed home that led to two-to-three times more bookings than the market average.

Airbnb coupled this initiative with other trust building processes such as placing a large weighting on user reviews in their aggregation model and holding payment for at least 24 hours after a user has checked-in to dissuade and prevent fraudulent or unrepresentative listings. By building a framework of trust between hosts and guests, Airbnb removed any barriers that would prevent the sharing of homes.

##### So, how does it make money?

Online marketplaces traditionally have 4 core revenue streams that they can generate fees out of their users (commission, transaction, listing and promotional fees). On the face of it, Airbnb seems to have opted to focus on generating their revenue from commission fees charged to guests (10% average) and transaction fees charged to hosts (3%). There are rumours that Airbnb has been testing promotional fees on their host at an extortionate 12%-15%, however, there seems to be no evidence that they have formalised this into their general business model. The omittance of listing fees seems to be slightly strange, though one could argue as a growing business they want to encourage the listing of homes on their platform by removing any barriers, however the supply of homes outstrips the annual demand and could therefore negatively affect their average daily rate (ADR), which in-turn reduces the amount they can collect from their main source of revenue - commission and transaction fees. I would guess this would effect more of their established markets.

Using Airbnb data supplied for New York, some key stats to look at relate to the average daily rate, annual compression nights and annual demand

##Key Stats

Average Daily Revenue (Non-Compression Nights): $177.03
Average Daily Revenue (Compression Nights): $183.73
Average No. of Compression Nights in New York (Last 10 years): 47
Bookings in New York State (2015): 1,496,260
Guest fee per transaction: 10%
Host fee per transaction: 3%
Revenue from guests: $26,617,379.07
Revenue from hosts: $7,985,213.72
Total Revenue: $34,602,592.80

##Annual Revenue - New York

This is an impressive figure on its own and considering it operates as an online marketplace, one would assume Airbnb’s costs would be significantly lower relative to the revenue they generate. To get a true sense of its market performance, it would be best to benchmark its efforts to the New York hotel market.

Hotel Premium on compression nights: 27.60%
Airbnb Premium on compression nights: 3.80%

##Compression nights - New York

Compression nights are an important indicator in the travel & hospitality business as it indicates periods where they can generate significant revenues due to the high demand. During these compression periods, Airbnb hosts do a poor job in converting the high demand into higher revenue as they charge on average a 3.8% premium. Looking at significant events and holidays***** in New York relative to the occupancy levels and ADR, it can be determined that Airbnb’s hosts have poor yield management strategies as the correlation between occupancy and ADR is only positively correlated at 0.57, while hotels manage their ADR more effectively at a correlation of 0.72******.

As Airbnb has centered their business model on the success of their hosts to attract guests, their host's poor yield management will directly impact Airbnb’s commission and transaction fees. If we take the assumption that hosts were able to effectively manage their ADR during high demand peaks and charge the hotel equivalent of a 27.6% premium, Airbnb has accumulated an opportunity cost in the region of $1 million.

##The Cost

Airbnb Average Daily Revenue (No Yield Management): $183.73
Airbnb Average Daily Revenue (Yield Management Assumption): $225.89
Total Revenue (No Yield Management): $34,602,592.80
Total Revenue (Yield Management Assumption): $35,658,580.59
Difference: $1,055,987.79

##### How does the future look?

Airbnb has a long-term regulatory battle on its hands and is in the midst of waging a lobbying effort on multiple fronts to preserve short-term lettings in major cities. Recently in San Francisco, Airbnb spent in the region of $8 million to defeat a single ballot initiative to shut-down their service. The defeat could be interpreted as a victory towards a more accepting regulatory attitude towards Airbnb’s business model but the evidence suggests that there will be a number of further proposals around the world. The problems are compounded when you consider that this comes at a time when tech start-ups are desperate to use their private funding to capture market share in Asia as competition heats up. Though Airbnb has been able to tap into over $200 million in private funding, if all their efforts are diverted into lobbying governments against these proposals, there won’t be much left in the war chest to channel into marketing campaigns. With rising housing prices in major cities and governments keen to preserve economic stability by making housing affordable, shutting out services like Airbnb will become a viable option to regulators. The future may look gloomy but if Airbnb can overcome this hurdle, they will surely cement their place in Silicon Valley folklore as the business that kept beating the odds.

Despite the uncertainty that lays ahead, one thing is for certain, the way we shop and cook for food will likely be reshaped by modern technology and a couple of Jamie Oliver inspired recipes.
