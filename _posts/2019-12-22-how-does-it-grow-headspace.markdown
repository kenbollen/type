##### Introduction

I have been a long-time user of the Headspace app, which describes itself as a digital health platform that provides guided meditation sessions and mindfulness training. I was first introduced to the app back in 2015 and have been a paying-user ever since. Since its founding in 2010, it has grown to be one of the top-grossing wellness apps in the world, capturing a significant % of the market along with its rival Calm.

Headspace’s growth into one of the biggest wellness apps has been an interesting case study of a sustainable growth strategy. I will break-down Headspace’s growth model as follows

##### The Habit Loops

The first layer of the growth model seeks to establish how the product retains its users through habits. The Habit loops best describe how a user develops a habit around the core use-case of the product. In Headspace’s case, the core use-case is taking a meditation session on the app. As a new user gets on-bordered, Headspace manufactures the habit loop by asking when the user wants to meditate and asking them to set an alarm to remind the user to meditate. This alarm serves to act as the manufactured trigger to get the user to meditate.

As the user develops a daily routine around guided meditation, the user develops an association with relieving their stress or busy mind through meditation.

This transitions the user into an environmental habit loop as to when they are triggered by a stressful event or finds their mind “busy” during their day, they will activate the Headspace app without the need for a daily alarm to receive their reward.

##### The User Acquisition Loops

The next layer of the growth model is user acquisition. What’s interesting about Headspace’s user acquisition is that they first came onto the scene in 2010 and were the first major entrant to the wellness app market. It’s arguable that Headspace’s growth was constrained back in 2010 as there was a certain stigma associated with mental wellness that prevented people from discussing it openly and a perception that it was reserved to people suffering from a clinical form of depression. 

This created a problem for Headspace as an early-stage company with limited resources where they couldn’t leverage low-cost acquisition channels such as virality to learn more about their market and customers. This is because to employ social virality, a user needs to gain social capital from creating awareness of the product, especially if there is no financial or personal utility to gain from sharing the app. The social stigma of mental wellness would have acted as a constraint against this virality and broken the loop.

To counter this, Headspace’s founder Andy Puddicombe, conducted a number of high profile PR interviews with the likes of Ellen Degeneres and Jimmy Fallon that discussed the merits of mindfulness, which acted as a linear activity to provide activation energy to the social virality loop.

These celebrity interviews provided the needed activation energy to the social virality loop as it worked to reduce the psychological constraints on user distribution by destigmatising the topic and creating the necessary social capital that a user can gain from sharing the app with their networks.

##### Activation Energy

Now with the required activation energy to kick start the social virality loop, Headspace introduced a new flow where a user would be prompted to invite their friends to 14 days of free paid content after completing a meditation session.

However, I believe there are a few deficiencies with the loop that prevents it from working to fully grow the user base. The loop attempts to employ a financial incentive for referral recipient without providing an incentive to the referral distributor, therefore, failing to complete the loop. As this prompt was set to take place after a user completes a meditation session, I believe the idea was to capitalise on the user’s delta of expectations vs experience, where a user is so happy with the meditation experience that they feel compelled to share the experience with their friends. Though a user may feel a certain positive experience after completing a meditation, I don’t think it has the 10x delta in expectation vs experience that would create a need to share with friends that would fuel the social virality loop. This is largely due to the level of competition within the wellness space that offers a similar experience, diluting the “wow” factor.

As the act of doing a meditation is a single-player value promise where the experience isn’t enhanced by more users on the platform, financial incentives are needed to get the user to distribute the value. However, a simple monetary incentive is insufficient as the referral should incentivize habit creation and not one-time use. Headspace achieves this part by centering the incentive to the value receiver around 14 days of free subscription content, which promotes habit creation through a time restricted period of multiple uses of the product. Additionally, by focusing the incentive on free meditation content, it aligns the currency of the incentive to the primary value promise, which increases the perceived value to the user but serves to limit the costs to Headspace. I believe to get this loop to function, Headspace need to offer a similar type of incentive to the value distributor. This can be achieved in a number of ways such as creating exclusive meditation content only accessible to users who refer X amount of users. For example, access to a meditation package a few weeks earlier than when it’s released on the platform when you refer 3 of your friends. Thus creating a value promise that incentivizes the value distributor to refer their friends to the platform.
